## RETURNING TO WORK

The central goverment announced that companies and factories can not start work before Feb. 3rd, 2020. After this announcement from central goverments, more and more local goverments announced their policies about when to return to work. Most of local goverments don't allow companies and factories open before Feb. 9th, 2020, and a few local goverments ask companies and factories closed until they think the coronavirus is in control by them.

Most of people are afraid to return to work, because they have to return to their work places by train, plane, or bus. Traffic tools are always crowed so that people be worried about cross infection. Offices are another high density places, therefore people desire working at home for a longer time.

Goverments announced two research results:

* Coronavirus can survive for up to 5 days in a proper environment.
* Asymptomatic infection can also be a source of infection.

So, people who will or have returned to work must be worried about that:

* Nothing can be touched.
* Is my workmate a virus infected?

From news, the central goverment has made many ecnomic policies to protect small and medium companies. All these policies focus on rent, employee salary, tax, shares, and credit. But people are not sure these policies effective. Because people afraid to walk on streets and talk to each other, so resturants and malls can not have customers as many as before.

In my opinion, private enterprises can not afford employee salary without business. For example, tourism industry must be damaged soon, because few people are brave enough to have a trip to any other city for days. However, not all industries will be damaged, instead, some industries are facing to a new opportunity that is most people prefer stay at home to be on the street. For example, game industry, especially, mobile game industry, reasons are:

* Developers can work at home, and cooperate with teammates remotely is normal and perfect in software companies.
* The period of mobile game development is short.
* Digital marketing is effective to mobile game development.
* Mobile game is cheap or free so that it is more acceptable than any other entertainment ways to people.

God bless China and Chinese people!
