## THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE

More deaths, suspected cases, and confirmed cases than yesterday, and there is still no effective cure for this disease. More and more countries, such as United States and Japan, have joint to the battle to coronavirus, and more and more famous news medias are focus on this topic. Therefore, the battle to coronavirus in China has envolved to a worldwide battle to coronavirus.

In the past recent days, less bad news appears in unofficial channel so that people who are far away from Wuhan relaxed vigilance gradually, more and more people walked on the street, I think, they were trying to return to their normal lives. With the release of rework time from the central and local goverments, people thought everthing had been in control.

However, with the latest data was published earlier today. The streets are calm again. Incidents of residents reporting their relatives appear in official and unofficial news. The basketball court in my residential area has been closed completely from now on, and the residential area has been dark from 8:00 PM. Less people and private cars in streets. The air is getting nervous than before.

Another major cause of tension is that rework is approaching. The central government has formulated a basic rework policy, and local goverments and industry management departments have formulated more detailed policies for their specific situations. People worry about how to protected themselves in the office.

So far as I know, most companies are extend their Chinese New Year holiday to Feb. 9th. Part of goverment departments and most public service departments and companies give up or shorten holidays. That's great to people.

For now, people don't worry about food, water, power, and networks at all. Instead, people worry about their jobs, incommings, companies, and heath in the future. People are waiting for the medical breakthrough to coronavirus.

My best wishes to China, my motherland, I am loving and living in.
