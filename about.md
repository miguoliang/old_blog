## Who am I

I am 15+ years experienced full stack developer in China. I am working in Changsha, Hunan. I have a company to help other companies on software development, seo, and technical consulting, and my company has been 5 years old.

## What's the blog for

Many kinds of projects I finished in the past years. I need to write something helpful here to help other developers who are facing some problems that I used to meet too.

## I hope more and more people can

1. Subscribe to my twitter, my facebook, and my mail list.
2. Get help from my shares.

## I desire to

1. Develop or maintain websites for NPOs that helps children or women. It's part-time and free.
2. Gain more business opportunities on technical consulting and software development.

## My work time

Monday - Friday, 9:00 ~ 17:30 GMT+8:00
