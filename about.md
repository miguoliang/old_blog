## About me

I am 15+ years experienced full stack developer in China. I am working in Changsha, Hunan. I have a company to help other companies on software development, seo, and technical consulting, and the company has been 5 years old.

## About this blog

Many kinds of projects I finished in the past years. I need to write something helpful here to help other developers who may be facing some problems that I used to meet too.

## My dreams

I want to do many things about my career, trips, foods, and values before the end of my life. I hope I can finish them someday. And I would like to share my goals with you, my guest, here:

- I dream to code for the future of the human being in Google or Tesla.
- I dream to travel to all the world wonder of Civilization VI in the real world.
- I dream to taste all delicious food around the world with my wife.
- I dream to write something helpful for others.
