## 1. The Record Does Not Start

When you have pressed the record button on the bottom right of the area selection window and pressed the save button on the Save Dialog, the stop button on the area selection window is still diabled.

Make sure the extension is typed in the file name input box on the save dialog.

After that, LICEcap works well.

## 2. Edit GIF Animation File Online

GIF animation file contains some frames, each frame is a separate picture. You can not edit it with normal software.

But what to do if you want to resize or crop a GIF animation file you just recorded. Record it again? You must don't want to do that.

[ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) is an online GIF editor for free, and it's easy to use. You can use it to resize, crop, convert to GIF from video, and make a gif.

What you need to do is just upload the GIF animation file you just recorded by LICEcap, then edit it, preview and download the final GIF to your disk.
